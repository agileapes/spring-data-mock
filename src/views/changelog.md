The original release with a complete rewrite of the initial platform.

This added many new features to the original code base, such as:

 mocking (such as binding mocks to an actual data store).
 * Use of listeners and auditing capabilities
 * Extensible operation handlers that would facilitate further
 enhancements
 * An extensible parser that supports newer operators
 * Better separation from the Spring Data codebase.
