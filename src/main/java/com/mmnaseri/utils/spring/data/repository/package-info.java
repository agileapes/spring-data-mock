/**
 * <p>This package implements the bridge pattern over the various repository interfaces in the Spring Data project.
 * Each class should represent exactly one repository interface in the Spring data project.</p>
 *
 * <p>Many of the interfaces in the Spring data project come with their own packaging and project. We have to check
 * for the presence of such an interface before adding the bridge for it to the classpath.</p>
